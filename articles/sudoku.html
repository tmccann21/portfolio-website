                <h3> Sudoku Variants </h3>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    <span class="tab" /> Most are familiar with the 9x9 Sudoku grid often found in the back of any
                    newspaper. The rules are simple: each row, column, and 3x3 region must uniquely contain the values
                    1 through 9, and there can be only one solution for the initial values given. These rules alone
                    can produce some very interesting and difficult puzzles, but the traditional rules can be further
                    expanded to produce some interesting and unique challenges as well.
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku#Variants" class="external-link fade-colour" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"> Common variations </a>
                    either change the size of the board, the shape of the the sub-regions (where
                    3x3 squares are normally used), or impose additional constraints on what values a cell can take.
                    The particular puzzle which inspired this article is the 'Magic Square Sudoku' by
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku#Variants" class="external-link fade-colour" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"> Aad van de Wetering </a>
                    which adds a few interesting constraints to make an otherwise unsolvable puzzle, solvable.

                    <span class="tab" /> A Sudoku with only 4 digits given could never have a single unique solution;
                    in fact, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2012/01/06/188520/mathematicians-solve-minimum-sudoku-problem/" class="external-link fade-colour" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">the minimum is 17</a>.
                    Therefore, in order for this puzzle to be solvable it's creator has imposed three constraints
                    in addition to the standard rules.
                </p>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    <span class="tab" /> The first additional constraint is that values along the two diagonal axis
                    (marked with blue lines in the image) also uniquely contain the values 1 through 9. The second rule
                    states that the center 3x3 square is also a
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square" class="external-link fade-colour" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"> Magic Square</a>.
                    This means the values of it's rows, columns, and diagonals all sum to the same value.
                    The final additional rule is known as an 'anti-knight' constraint, in reference to the movements
                    of the knight in chess. This rule states cells which are a knight's move apart cannot contain the
                    same value. In the example below, cells coloured yellow cannot also contain the value 4 due to
                    this constraint.

                <p class="article-paragraph">

                    walking through it step-by-step. Instead, I'll be using linear programming to solve this problem.
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming" class="external-link fade-colour" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"> Linear Programming</a>
                    is a method to optimize a linear objective function given a system of linear constraints. Sudoku can
                    be expressed as a specific type of linear program knows as a
                    <span class="italics"> binary integer linear program</span>.
                </p>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    <span class="tab"/> Posing a Sudoku as a linear program is not a new idea;
                    <a href="https://diego.assencio.com/?index=25ea1e49ca59de51b4ef6885dcc3ee3b" class="external-link fade-colour" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">thorough examples</a>
                    do a great job of explaining every step of translating the Sudoku puzzle to a set of linear
                    constraints. In brief summary, for every cell we introduce 9 binary decision variables, for a total
                    of 729 to represent the puzzle. Each decision variable - indexed by it's row, column, and value -
                    reflects whether or not that value is picked for that cell. For example if X₁₁₃ = 1, this means that
                    the value of the cell in the top left corner is 3. You will also notice we use an arbitrary constant
                    objective function, as there is no way to improve a Sudoku solution we are just looking for a set
                    of values which satisfies all the constraints. With that, here is the linear program for the
                    standard Sudoku rules:

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    <span class="tab"/> The first sum constrains each cell, indexed by it's row and column to take on
                    only one value. The next two constraints reflect the standard rule that each row and column contain
                    the values 1 through 9 uniquely. The fourth sum maintains that each sub-grid also contains the values
                    1 through 9. In order to incorporate the additional rules of the <span class="italics">Magic Square Sudoku</span>
                    we'll need a few more constraints. The first two additional summations express that along each diagonal,
                    the values between 1 and 9 appears exactly once.

                    this variable is the magic number for the magic square, which each row, column, and diagonal sum to.
                    The nuance of these equations is in multiplying the variable index
                    <span class="inline-code">v</span> by the value of X<sub>rcv</sub> which is either a binary 1
                    or 0 to get the real value of the cell. We sum these values along each row, column, and diagonal of
                    the center 3x3 grid, then subtract <span class="inline-code">M</span> to enforce that everything

                    <span class="tab"/> Translating the knight's move constraint to a system of linear expressions is a
                    bit more challenging. Intuitively, it would be nice to use the same trick from our magic square
                    constraint to get the actual value of a cell, then compare it to that of the cells in the knight's
                    move positions. Unfortunately, the idea of 'not equals' is harder to encode; it
                    <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1517850" class="external-link fade-colour" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">can be done </a>
                    by introducing an additional boolean variable but there's an easier way to represent this constraint
                    for our specific problem.
                </p>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    <span class="tab"/> Instead of trying to encode the idea that 'the value of cell A is not equal
                    to the value of cell B', we can enforce that 'at most one of cell A or cell B can have value <span
                    class="inline-code">X</span>'. For each cell, we iterate over every value and check that either
                    one or zero of those cells has that value set. This achieves the effect we want, but it comes at a
                    cost of adding 9 inequalities for every knights move of every cell on the board. In a theoretical
                    context this doesn't matter, but we'll see when we actually build a solver that this has a real
                    impact on the time to find a solution. There are a few optimizations which can reduce the
                    actual number of knight's move positions considered but overall they still make up over 90% of the
                    constraints in the model.

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    <span class="tab" /> I'll be using the Python linear programming library
                    <a href="https://pypi.org/project/PuLP/" class="external-link fade-colour" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"> PuLP </a>
                    to handle the heavy lifting of actually solving linear programs. Instead of writing a Sudoku solver
                    from scratch I'll be building on top of
                    <a href="https://github.com/coin-or/pulp/blob/master/examples/Sudoku1.py" class="external-link fade-colour" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"> PuLP's own implementation</a>
                    of a generic Sudoku solver. I'll focus on the code for the new constraints I've added in this
                    article, but the full source code can be found on my Github
                    <a href="https://github.com/tmccann21/mini-projects/sudoku/sudoku.py" class="external-link fade-colour" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.

                <h4>Diagonals</h4>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    <span class="tab" /> Translating the constraints for the diagonals from their mathematical
                    expressions to Python code is almost identical to the existing constraints for the rows and columns.
                    PuLP's lpSum calculates a sum from a vector of linear expressions. We can then add this as a
                    constraint directly to our problem.

                    diagonal constraints, this is a pretty faithful recreation of the mathematical expression we
                    defined earlier so there's not a lot of surprises.

                <h4>Knight's Move</h4>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    <span class="tab"/>For the knight's move we define the eight possible knight's move offsets as a
                    constant. We iterate over every cell and define a constraint for every value expressing that either
                    one or fewer of the cells can take that value. As mentioned before, the knight's move constraint
                    generates most of the complexity of our model. I've add a variable outside of the linear program to
                    keep track of the number of constraints we generate here. With no optimizations, that number is
                    4032 out of 4386 total constraints in the model.
                </p>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    <span class="tab"/>To reduce this I've included a simple optimization in the helper function to
                    protect against invalid indices. It also ignores the constraint if the knight's move falls within
                    the same 3x3 grid that the target cell is in. This works because that case is trivially covered by
                    the standard Sudoku rules for 3x3 sub-grids. This simple check reduces the total number of constraints
                    in our model to 3090, with 2736 being from knight's moves.

                    For starters you could significantly reduce the number of constraints by considering the fact that
                    if cell A is a knight's move from cell B, cell B is also a knight's move from cell A. In other
                    words, every knight's move constraint is duplicated by the paired cell. My understanding is part
                    of the pre-processor for the generic PuLP solver tries to eliminate as many trivially redundant
                    constraints as it can so whether this will really make a difference is questionable but at the
                    very least you can reduce the size of the model.
